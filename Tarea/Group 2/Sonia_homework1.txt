Nombre de la cancion: It's My Life

Letra de la cancion------------------
This ain't a song for the brokenhearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed
And I ain't going to be just a face in the crowd
You're going to hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't going to live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
Because it's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't going to live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
Because it's my life

You better stand tall
When they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break
Baby, don't back down

It's my life
It's now or never
Because I ain't going to live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
(bis)
