Song : ItÂ´s My life

Funny how I find myself in love with you
If I could buy my reasoning, I'd pay to lose
One half won't do
I've asked myself, how much do you
Commit yourself?
It's my life, don't you forget
It's my life, it never ends (it never ends)
Funny how I blind myself, I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon, afraid to lose
I'd tell myself, what good you do
Convince myself
It's my life, don't you forget
It's my life, it never ends (it never ends)
I've asked myself, how much do you
Commit yourself?
It's my life, don't you forget
Caught in the crowd, it never ends
It's my life, don't you forget
Caught in the crowd, it never ends
It's my life, don't you forget
Caught in the crowd, it never ends
