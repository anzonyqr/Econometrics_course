Heretic - Gable Price and Friends

You are the empire
The promised land beneath my feet
The contrast, that offends my firm theology
We tried to fit your ways
In the boxes humans made
So either you're a heretic
Or you're the son of God
You are the relapse
Of quiet streams and greener paths
The foot-notes, of ancient words our language lacks
We could scribble out the notes in the books that your friends wrote
Cause either everyone's a heretic
Or they've heard the voice of God
Ooooh
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
And break my heart so it looks more like yours
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
Offend my mind
Offend my mind
You are the contrast
A tender word and a stomach leap
The constant, offending Greek mythology
Capitalize the "G" in the name of He who bleeds
You really resurrect me
Tell me directly, am I just a modern pharisee
Do my thoughts scream a renewed mind or just words I speak
And if you walk into my home and you make your glory known
Would my tears soak your feet
Or would I crucify you
Ooooh
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
And break my heart so it looks more like yours
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
Offend my mind
Ooooh
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
And break my heart so it looks more like yours
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
Offend my mind
Ooooooh
Prophet and the priest
Crucify my disbelief
The divine reminds me of the hope inside me
Oooooh
Counter of the stars
Resurrect my broken heart
The contrast soothes my mind
You're the earth that I reside in
I break the rules, you break the silence
I see the power in your eyes
You're glorious, I'm terrified
A grain of sand upon an island
The real estate inside your eyelids
I'm a tooth inside a smile
I'm the soul you reconciled
Would you offend my mind
Offend my mind
Offend my mind
Offend my mind
Would you offend my mind
Offend my mind
Ooooh
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
And break my heart so it looks more like yours
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
Offend my mind
Ooooh
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
And break my heart so it looks more like yours
Offend my mind so that I can know you more
Offend my mind
Offend my mind
