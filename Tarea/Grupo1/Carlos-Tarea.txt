Lyrics

Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn’t make a killing
Didn’t have a dime
But I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Didn’t know how
But I always had a feeling
I was going to be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything
Wanted everything
Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything
Wanted everything
Mama said don’t give up
It’s a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
And I’d hate to see you waiting
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn’t make a killing
Didn’t have a dime
But I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Didn’t know how
But I always had a feeling
I was going to be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said
It’s uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
Ain’t ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don’t ever change
We wanted everything
Wanted everything
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise
And never come down
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise
And never come down
Mama said don’t give up
It’s a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
And I’d hate to see you waiting
They say it’s all been done
But they haven’t seen the best of me
So I got one more run
And it’s going to be a sight to see
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn’t make a killing
Didn’t have a dime
But I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Didn’t know how
But I always had a feeling
I was going to be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars
When I couldn’t make a killing
Didn’t have a dime
But I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high
High hopes for a living
Didn’t know how
But I always had a feeling
I was going to be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
